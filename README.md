Description
--------------------

An exploratory proteome analysis of breast cancer proteomes dataset as part of the DTU 22100 "R for Data Science" course.


Data
--------------------
This data set contains published iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples, RNAseq with Cancer label metadata which was used to cluster the cancer types based on the protein expresion landscape. 


The data contain 3 files: 
* Protome data: proteome expression data for 105 patients
* Clinical data: clinical labels for patient outcomes 
* PAM50: Information on proteins which is significant in breast cancers

The data is available in this git under data/\_raw. 

The data was originally found on Kaggle:

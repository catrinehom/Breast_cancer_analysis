Description
--------------------

An exploratory proteome analysis of breast cancer proteomes dataset as part of the DTU 22100 "R for Data Science" course. The project includes an exploritory data analysis, PCA clustering and an ANN on the data.


Data
--------------------
The data for this project contains iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples from patients. The data contains protein expression values for over 12.000 proteins for each patient, however with some missing values for the proteins that could not be quantified.

The data contain 3 files: 
* Protome data: proteome expression data for 105 patients
* Clinical data: clinical labels for patient outcomes 
* PAM50: Information on proteins which is significant in breast cancer

The data is available in this git under data/\_raw. 

The data was originally found on Kaggle:

#### Descritpion

This data set contains published iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples, RNAseq with Cancer label metadata which was used to cluster the cancer types based on the protein expresion landscape.

#### Data:

3 files: expression data fora set of genes, clinical lablels for patient outcomes and protein categories for clustering, please the an overview of the data below.
